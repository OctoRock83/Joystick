# Joystick
Turning a tractor joystick into a computer gamepad
HOUR - 1 I first started with taking apart controller, and researched ways to convert movement to something the computer can read
Hour - 2 I worked on the part to transfer motion, and came up with a design
Hour - 3 I worked on another aprt, didnt finish it tho, but I printed V1 of the motion transfer part and it broke
Hour - 4 I assembled the joystick, with the modeled parts, and it worked! until it broke :(
